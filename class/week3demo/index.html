    <h1>This week, we're exploring CSS.</h1>
    <p>Stick with the basics, as much as you can understand. Color, text styling, spacing and sizing are all good places to start. In coming weeks, we'll dive into web typography, layout and animation- so it's more than ok to keep it simple for now.</p>
    <h3>Happy coding!</h3>
