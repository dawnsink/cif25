        <h1>What Kind of Times Are These</h1>
        <h3>by Adrienne Rich</h3>
        
        <div class="flex-container">
          <div> 
            <p>
              There's a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill
              <br>
                and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows
              <br>
                near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted
              <br>
                who disappeared into those shadows.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <p>
              I've walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don't be fooled
              <br>
                this isn't a Russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here,
              <br>
                our country moving closer to its own truth and dread,
              <br>
                its own ways of making people disappear.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <p>
              I won't tell you where the place is, the dark mesh of the woods
              <br>
                meeting the unmarked strip of lightâ€”
              <br>
                ghost-ridden crossroads, leafmold paradise:
              <br>
                I know already who wants to buy it, sell it, make it disappear.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <p>
              And I won't tell you where it is, so why do I tell you
              <br>
                anything? Because you still listen, because in times like these
              <br>
                to have you listen at all, it's necessary
              <br>
                to talk about trees.
            </p>
